### In Loving Memory of [Joe Ipson](https://github.com/m0ngr31)

_This project is dedicated to [Joe Ipson](https://github.com/m0ngr31), the original creator of DailyNotes, who passed away in the summer of 2025 after a courageous battle with cancer._

Joe was a kindred spirit who believed in the simple power of writing things down. He built DailyNotes to bring the mindful experience of a physical planner into the digital world. His vision was to create something personal, self-hosted, and beautifully simple.

This project continues in his memory. Every commit, every feature, every bug fix is a small tribute to a dear friend whose spirit lives on in the code he wrote and the ideas he shared.

_Rest easy, Joe. We'll take it from here._

## About

The idea for this app came from using my Hobonichi Techo planner every morning to write down what I needed to accomplish that day & using it for scratching down random thoughts and notes as the day went on. The closest thing I've seen to an app for replacing this system is Noteplan, but I don't use a Mac or an iOS device, and it's not self-hostable, so I decided to write my own.

To check your current version, open **Settings** in the app and look in the **About** section.

Since I had the need for keeping track of to-dos throughout the day, regular Markdown didn't work for me since it doesn't natively support tasks. So as an alternative I'm using Github Flavored Markdown (GFM). I really wanted it to feel like an actual text editor and not just a textbox, so I decided to use CodeMirror to handle all the input. Fira Code is used to provide font ligatures. Some other nice features include code highlighting, text/code folding, and a task list where you can toggle the status of any task from any date or note.

## Features

Joe had a vision for what DailyNotes could become before calling it a 1.0 release. I've done my best to interpret and implement those features, along with feature requests from GitHub issues that Joe was considering. Here's what makes DailyNotes a powerful daily planning tool:

### Core Experience

- **GitHub Flavored Markdown** — Full GFM support with task lists (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`), tables, code blocks, and more
- **CodeMirror Editor** — A real text editor experience with syntax highlighting, code folding, and keyboard shortcuts
- **Fira Code Font** — Beautiful font ligatures for a polished writing experience
- **Auto-save** — Never lose your work with optional automatic saving
- **Data Encryption** — All notes encrypted at rest with AES encryption

### Organization & Search

- **[Powerful Search](#search)** — Syntax-based search with `tag:`, `project:`, and full-text queries
- **[Nested Tags](#nested-tags)** — Hierarchical tag organization (e.g., `work/meetings`, `home/family`)
- **[Kanban Board](#kanban-board)** — Visual task management with drag-and-drop columns
- **Task List** — View and toggle tasks within each note with one-click status updates

### Preview & Visualization

- **[HTML Preview](#mermaid-diagrams)** — Live markdown preview with `Cmd+K V` (side-by-side) or `Shift+Cmd+V` (full screen)
- **[Mermaid Diagrams](#mermaid-diagrams)** — Create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, ERDs, and more directly in your notes
- **[Themes](#themes)** — Light, Dark, and System themes to match your environment

### Calendar Integration

- **[Calendar Feed (ICS)](#calendar-feed-ics)** — Subscribe to your notes in Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any ICS-compatible app
- **External Calendar Support** — Display events from external ICS feeds alongside your daily notes

### Self-Hosted & Private

- **Self-hosted** — Your data stays on your server, under your control
- **Docker Ready** — Easy deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
- **Multi-user Support** — Multiple users with separate, encrypted data
- **No Vendor Lock-in** — Export all your notes as markdown files anytime

## Themes

DailyNotes supports **Light**, **Dark**, and **System** themes to match your preferred working environment.

### Theme Options

| Theme     | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🌙 Dark   | Default dark interface, optimized for low-light environments       |
| ☀️ Light  | Clean, bright interface with light backgrounds                     |
| 💻 System | Automatically follows your operating system's color scheme setting |

### How to Change Themes

1. Click the **menu icon** (⋮) in the header
2. Select **Settings**
3. In the **Appearance** section, click your preferred theme
4. The theme changes instantly and is saved for future sessions

The **System** option automatically switches between light and dark themes based on your OS settings (e.g., macOS Dark Mode, Windows Dark Theme). This is perfect if you prefer dark mode at night and light mode during the day.

## Mermaid Diagrams

DailyNotes supports [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams in the markdown preview, allowing you to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more directly in your notes.

### Creating Diagrams

Use a fenced code block with `mermaid` as the language:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Do something]
    B -->|No| D[Do something else]
    C --> E[End]
    D --> E
```
````

### Viewing Diagrams

Diagrams are rendered in the HTML preview:

- **Side-by-side**: Press `Cmd+K V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K V` (Windows/Linux)
- **Preview only**: Press `Shift+Cmd+V` (Mac) or `Shift+Ctrl+V` (Windows/Linux)

### Supported Diagram Types

Mermaid supports many diagram types. Here are some examples:

| Diagram Type        | Use Case                 | Example Syntax           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Flowchart           | Process flows, decisions | `graph TD` or `graph LR` |
| Sequence            | API calls, interactions  | `sequenceDiagram`        |
| Class               | Object relationships     | `classDiagram`           |
| State               | State machines           | `stateDiagram-v2`        |
| Entity Relationship | Database schemas         | `erDiagram`              |
| Gantt               | Project timelines        | `gantt`                  |
| Pie                 | Data distribution        | `pie`                    |
| Git Graph           | Branch visualization     | `gitGraph`               |

### Theme Support

Diagrams automatically adapt to your app theme:

- **Dark theme**: Diagrams render with dark-friendly colors
- **Light theme**: Diagrams render with light-friendly colors
- Switching themes re-renders diagrams with the appropriate color scheme

### Error Handling

If a diagram has syntax errors, DailyNotes displays a helpful error message instead of breaking the preview. This makes it easy to debug and fix diagram issues.

### Learn More

For full syntax documentation and examples, visit the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).

## Calendar feed (ICS)

- Generate or rotate a private read-only ICS URL with `GET/POST /api/calendar_token` (requires auth).
- Subscribe in Google Calendar via **Settings -> Add calendar -> From URL** using `/api/calendar.ics?token=<your_token>`.
- Each daily note becomes an all-day event; the feed updates when notes change (Google polls periodically).
- Rotate the token to immediately revoke previous subscriptions or disable sharing with `DELETE /api/calendar_token`.
- You can now subscribe to external ICS feeds (e.g., Google private links) in Settings; DailyNotes shows those events on the matching day.

## Search

DailyNotes features a powerful syntax-based search that lets you quickly find notes using text queries.

### Search Syntax

| Syntax             | Description              | Example             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| `tag:value`        | Filter by tag            | `tag:meeting`       |
| `project:value`    | Filter by project        | `project:work`      |
| `t:value`          | Shorthand for tag        | `t:1on1`            |
| `p:value`          | Shorthand for project    | `p:DN`              |
| `tag:"multi word"` | Quoted values for spaces | `tag:"code review"` |
| Plain text         | Search note content      | `budget report`     |

### Example Searches

| Query                         | What it finds                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `budget`                      | All notes containing "budget"                    |
| `tag:meeting`                 | All notes tagged "meeting"                       |
| `project:work tag:Q4`         | Notes in "work" project with "Q4" tag            |
| `tag:1on1 tag:feedback`       | Notes with both tags (AND)                       |
| `project:DN project:personal` | Notes in either project (OR)                     |
| `tag:meeting notes agenda`    | Tagged "meeting" containing "notes" AND "agenda" |

### Search Logic

- **Multiple tags** = AND (note must have all specified tags)
- **Multiple projects** = OR (note can be in any specified project)
- **Multiple text terms** = AND (note must contain all words)

### Features

- **Autocomplete**: Type `tag:` or `project:` to see suggestions from your existing tags/projects
- **Keyboard navigation**: Use arrow keys to select, Tab/Enter to confirm
- **Result highlighting**: Matching text is highlighted in search results with context snippets
- **Syntax help**: Click the `?` button for a quick reference

## Nested Tags

DailyNotes supports hierarchical tag organization using `/` as a delimiter. This lets you create tag hierarchies like `work/meetings`, `home/family`, or `projects/dailynotes/frontend`.

### Creating Nested Tags

Use the `/` character in your frontmatter to create nested tags:

```markdown
---
title: Weekly Team Sync
tags: work/meetings, work/1on1, home/family
---
```

### Sidebar Display

Nested tags appear as a collapsible tree in the sidebar:

| Display      | Description                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `▶ work`     | Collapsed parent tag (click arrow to expand) |
| `▼ work`     | Expanded parent showing children below       |
| `  meetings` | Child tag indented under parent              |
| `1on1`       | Flat tag (no `/`) displayed inline at top    |

- **Flat tags** (without `/`) are displayed inline at the top, wrapping as needed
- **Parent tags** show a collapsible chevron (▶/▼)
- **Child tags** are displayed inline under their parent when expanded
- **Expand/collapse state** is saved and persists across page refreshes

### Search Behavior

Nested tags support hierarchical search - searching for a parent tag matches all its children:

| Search Query        | Matches                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `tag:work`          | Notes with `work`, `work/meetings`, `work/1on1` |
| `tag:work/meetings` | Only notes with exactly `work/meetings`         |
| `tag:home`          | Notes with `home`, `home/family`, `home/tech`   |

This makes it easy to search broadly (`tag:work` for all work-related notes) or specifically (`tag:work/meetings` for just meeting notes).

### Examples

| Tags in Frontmatter                  | Sidebar Display                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `tags: meeting, 1on1, review`        | `meeting` `1on1` `review` (inline) |
| `tags: work/meetings, work/reviews`  | `▼ work` → `meetings` `reviews`    |
| `tags: home/tech, home/family, work` | `▼ home` → `family` `tech`, `work` |

### Tips

- **Existing tags are unchanged**: Tags without `/` continue to work exactly as before
- **Autocomplete works**: Type `tag:work/` to see suggestions for nested tags
- **Mix and match**: You can use both flat and nested tags in the same note
- **Deep nesting**: Multiple levels work too: `projects/dailynotes/frontend/components`

## Kanban Board

DailyNotes includes an optional Kanban board view for organizing tasks with drag-and-drop support.

### Enabling Kanban

1. Click the **menu icon** (⋮) in the header
2. Select **Settings**
3. Find the **Kanban** section
4. Toggle **Enable Kanban board**

When enabled, the Tasks icon in the header changes to a columns icon. Click it to open the Kanban modal.

### Task Syntax

Use the `>>column` syntax at the end of any task to assign it to a specific column:

| Task Syntax                         | Column Assignment                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `- [ ] Plain task`                  | Defaults to "todo"                |
| `- [x] Completed task`              | Defaults to "done"                |
| `- [ ] In progress >>doing`         | Explicit "doing" column           |
| `- [x] Done but in review >>review` | Stays in "review" (explicit wins) |

**Column names** support letters, numbers, and hyphens: `>>in-progress`, `>>stage-2`, `>>Q4`

### Default Columns

| Setting         | Default Value     |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Default columns | `todo`, `done`    |
| Configurable in | Settings → Kanban |

Add, remove, or reorder columns in the Settings panel.

### Per-Note Column Override

Override columns for a specific note using YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: Sprint Planning
kanban:
  - backlog
  - in-progress
  - review
  - done
---

- [ ] Design mockups >>backlog
- [ ] Implement API >>in-progress
- [ ] Write tests >>review
```

### Auto-Column Creation

If you use a column that doesn't exist in your configuration:

| Scenario                | Result                                         |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Columns: `[todo, done]` | Default setup                                  |
| Task uses `>>staging`   | Columns become `[todo, staging, done]`         |
| Task uses `>>review`    | Columns become `[todo, staging, review, done]` |

New columns are automatically inserted **before "done"**. To reorder, update the columns in Settings or note frontmatter.

### Drag and Drop

- **Drag** any task card to move it between columns
- The task's `>>column` syntax is automatically updated in the markdown
- Changes are saved immediately to the note

### Column Assignment Rules

| Condition                                | Resulting Column     |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| No `>>column` + unchecked `[ ]`          | `todo`               |
| No `>>column` + checked `[x]`            | `done`               |
| Explicit `>>column` (any checkbox state) | The specified column |

**Key point**: Explicit `>>column` syntax always takes precedence over the checkbox state. This lets you have completed tasks in a "review" column.

#### Docker Run

By default, the easiest way to get running is:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v /config_dir:/app/config xhenxhe/dailynotes
```

#### Docker Compose

Here is a complete docker-compose example with all configuration options:

```yaml
services:
  dailynotes:
    image: xhenxhe/dailynotes:latest
    container_name: DailyNotes
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    volumes:
      # Persistent storage for database and config
      - ./dailynotes-data:/app/config
    environment:
      # Required: Secret key for signing JWT tokens
      # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
      API_SECRET_KEY: 'your-secure-api-secret-key-here'

      # Required: Encryption key for data at rest (must be multiple of 16)
      # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
      # WARNING: Changing this will make existing data unreadable!
      DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY: 'your-secure-db-encryption-key-here'

      # Optional: Database connection string
      # Default: SQLite database in /app/config/app.db
      # Examples:
      #   PostgreSQL: postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dailynotes
      #   MySQL:      mysql+pymysql://user:password@host:3306/dailynotes?charset=utf8mb4
      # DATABASE_URI: "sqlite:////app/config/app.db"

      # Optional: Prevent new user signups (set to any value to disable)
      # PREVENT_SIGNUPS: "true"

      # Optional: Base URL when using a reverse proxy subfolder
      # Example: If accessing via https://example.com/notes, set to "/notes"
      # BASE_URL: ""

      # Optional: Set user/group ID for file permissions
      # Useful for matching host user permissions
      # PUID: "1000"
      # PGID: "1000"
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Optional: Health check
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'curl', '-f', 'http://localhost:8000/health']
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
# Optional: Use with PostgreSQL
#  postgres:
#    image: postgres:15-alpine
#    container_name: dailynotes-db
#    environment:
#      POSTGRES_DB: dailynotes
#      POSTGRES_USER: dailynotes
#      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your-secure-db-password
#    volumes:
#      - ./postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
#    restart: unless-stopped
```

**Quick Start with Docker Compose:**

1. Save the above as `docker-compose.yml`
2. Generate secure keys:

   ```bash
   # Generate API secret key
   openssl rand -hex 32

   # Generate DB encryption key
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

3. Update the `API_SECRET_KEY` and `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` values
4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
5. Access at `http://localhost:8000`

**Important Notes:**

- The `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` encrypts all your notes. **Never change it** after initial setup or your data will be unreadable!
- The `./dailynotes-data` directory will store your database and configuration
- The default port is now `8000` for better compatibility

### Reverse Proxy

If you're running DailyNotes behind a reverse proxy, here are example configurations for popular web servers.

<details>
<summary><strong>Caddy</strong></summary>

Caddy automatically handles HTTPS certificates. Add to your `Caddyfile`:

```caddyfile
dailynotes.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8000
}
```

For a subfolder setup:

```caddyfile
example.com {
    handle_path /notes/* {
        reverse_proxy localhost:8000
    }
}
```

Set `BASE_URL=/notes` in your DailyNotes environment when using a subfolder.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Nginx</strong></summary>

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name dailynotes.example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

For a subfolder setup:

```nginx
location /notes/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8000/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

Set `BASE_URL=/notes` in your DailyNotes environment when using a subfolder.

For HTTPS, add SSL configuration or use Certbot: `sudo certbot --nginx -d dailynotes.example.com`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Apache</strong></summary>

Enable required modules:

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http headers
```

Virtual host configuration:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName dailynotes.example.com

    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:8000/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8000/

    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "http"
</VirtualHost>
```

For a subfolder setup:

```apache
<Location /notes>
    ProxyPass http://localhost:8000
    ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8000
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "http"
</Location>
```

Set `BASE_URL=/notes` in your DailyNotes environment when using a subfolder.

For HTTPS, use Certbot: `sudo certbot --apache -d dailynotes.example.com`

## Development setup

### Option 1: Docker Development Environment (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started with development is using Docker. This approach provides:

- ✅ Consistent environment across all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- ✅ No need to install Python, Node.js, or manage versions
- ✅ Hot-reloading for both frontend and backend code
- ✅ Automatic database setup and migrations
- ✅ Isolated environment that won't affect your system

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Start the development environment (builds, starts, and opens browser)
./dev
```

That's it! The script will:

1. Build the development Docker image
2. Start both Quart backend (port 8000) and Vue.js (port 8080) servers
3. Set up the database and run migrations
4. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080

**Development Workflow:**

All your code changes will be automatically detected:

- **Python/Quart changes**: Uvicorn server auto-reloads
- **Vue.js changes**: Hot module replacement (HMR) updates the browser instantly
- **Database**: Persisted in `./config/app.db` on your host machine

**Useful Commands:**

```bash
# View live logs from both servers
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# Stop the development environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

# Restart services
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart

# Access the container shell (for debugging)
docker exec -it dailynotes-dev bash

# Rebuild after dependency changes
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
```

**Testing with PostgreSQL or MySQL:**

DailyNotes supports PostgreSQL and MySQL in addition to SQLite. To test with these databases:

```bash
# Start with PostgreSQL
./dev --postgres

# Start with MySQL
./dev --mysql

# Stop any database environment
./dev --down
```

These use production-like Docker Compose configurations (`docker-compose-postgres.yml` and `docker-compose-mysql.yml`) that include the database servers. The database data is persisted in Docker volumes.

**File Structure:**

- `Dockerfile.dev` - Development Docker image with both Python and Node.js
- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development compose config with volume mounts
- `docker-compose-postgres.yml` - PostgreSQL testing configuration
- `docker-compose-mysql.yml` - MySQL testing configuration
- `docker-entrypoint-dev.sh` - Startup script that runs both servers

**What's Mounted:**

The following directories are mounted from your host to enable hot-reloading:

- `./app/` - Python backend code
- `./client/src/` - Vue.js source code
- `./client/public/` - Static assets
- `./config/` - Database and environment variables (persisted)
- `./migrations/` - Database migrations

**Environment Variables:**

By default, the development environment will auto-generate secure keys in `./config/.env`. To customize:

```yaml
# Edit docker-compose.dev.yml
environment:
  API_SECRET_KEY: 'your-dev-key'
  DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY: 'your-16-char-multiple-key'
  PREVENT_SIGNUPS: 'true' # Optional: disable signups
```

### Option 2: Local Development Setup

If you prefer to run services directly on your host machine:

#### Automated Setup (macOS/Linux)

The easiest way to set up your development environment is to use the automated setup script:

```bash
./dev-setup.sh
```

This script will:

- Check for Python 3 and Node.js
- Automatically use Node.js 16 via nvm (if available)
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Install all Python dependencies
- Install all Node.js dependencies
- Generate environment configuration

After setup completes, run the development servers:

```bash
# Backend (in one terminal)
source venv/bin/activate
./run.sh

# Frontend (in another terminal)
cd client
npm run dev  # Uses Node 16 via nvm automatically
```

**Note:** The project includes a `.nvmrc` file that specifies Node.js 16. If you have nvm installed, it will automatically use the correct version.

### Manual Setup (Windows or alternative)

If you're on Windows or prefer to set up manually:

#### Installing dependencies

You need Python 3.8+ and Node.js 16 installed.

**Recommended:** Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) to manage Node.js versions. The project includes a `.nvmrc` file that specifies Node.js 16.

```bash
# If using nvm (recommended)
nvm install 16
nvm use 16

# Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd client
npm ci
```

#### Creating the environment

You can use the environment variables from above, or you can generate new ones by running the following:

```bash
./verify_env.py
```

Keep in mind that since the data is encrypted, if you modify the `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` variable, your data will not be accessible anymore.

#### Running

During development you need to run the client and server simultaneously

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Run backend
./run.sh
```

```bash
# In a separate terminal
cd client

# If using nvm, switch to Node 16 first (or run npm run dev)
nvm use  # Reads from .nvmrc file

# Start frontend dev server
npm run serve
# Or use the dev script which automatically uses Node 16:
npm run dev
```
